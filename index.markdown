The Green IT Summer School is a thematic school designed to train engineers, researchers, developers, and academic and industrial stakeholders on the challenges, tools, and solutions surrounding Green IT.

The goal of this summer school is to invite leading scientific experts in Green IT to share the current state of knowledge and best practices with those who are shaping and will shape the sustainable computing of tomorrow.

The school invites a diverse range of speakers (professors, researchers, and professionals) recognized in the fields of sustainable computing, Green IT, energy (hardware and software), and data centers and cloud computing. These experts come from French, European and worldwide institutions, associations, and industries.
